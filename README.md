# Passenger-Survival-Prediction

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the survival of passengers on Titanic based on various factors. 
The dataset is taken from https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic.

In-depth analysis using various statistical models is conducted to determine the key factors that affect a passenger's survival. 
Then, machine learning (KNN model) was applied to predict the given list of passengers.

As a result, a ~70% accuracy is achieved in correctly forecasting passenger survival.
